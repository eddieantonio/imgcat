\f[B]imgcat\f[R] - cat, but for images
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]imgcat\f[R] \f[B][options]\f[R] \f[I]image\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[B]imgcat\f[R] \f[B][options]\f[R] < \f[I]image\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]imgcat\f[R] prints an image to your terminal screen.
.PP
The image can either be provided as a command line argument, or can be
piped in through \f[C]stdin\f[R].
.PP
By default, the image is printed at the full width and color depth
detected for your terminal.
This can be overridden using \f[B]-w\f[R] to adjust the maximum width or
\f[B]-R\f[R] to prevent resizing, even if the image is too big to fit in
the terminal; and \f[B]-d\f[R] to explicitly set the color depth.
You may also use \f[B]-r\f[R] to adjust the height (\[dq]r\[dq] for
\[dq]number of rows\[dq]).
If only one of \f[B]-w\f[R] or \f[B]-r\f[R] is provided, the image will
be scaled without affecting the aspect ratio, if possible.
.PP
Setting \f[B]-H\f[R] enables the use of half-height block drawing
characters (as opposed to \[dq]full height\[dq] spaces used in the
default mode).
This effectively doubles the vertical resolution of the terminal, and
thus the image on your terminal will appear less \[dq]squished\[dq], and
will appear as if it has better pixel resolution.
Note that this effect works best on terminals that output using a
bitmapped font, and have a line height of exactly 100%
(example (https://git.io/vhW5F)).
Using anti-aliased fonts may distort the blocks, and using a taller line
height will make the half-height block cover \f[I]less\f[R] than half of
the block, further distorting the image
(example (https://git.io/vhW5d)).
Your millage may vary.
.PP
If the output is not a terminal (that is, output is redirected to a
file, or piped into another program), then the image is \f[B]not\f[R]
resized and the color depth is set to 8 colors.
Overriding both width, height, and color depth still work.
.PP
\f[B]Make sure your \f[CB]TERM\f[B] environment variable is set to a
terminfo with the full capabilities of you terminal!\f[R] See
\f[B]Troubleshooting\f[R] if you\[aq]re having a problem with this.
.SS Options
.TP
.B \f[B]-d\f[R] \f[I]MODE\f[R], \f[B]--depth\f[R]=\f[I]MODE\f[R]
Explicitly set the output color depth to one of \f[B]ansi\f[R],
\f[B]8\f[R] (alias of \f[B]ansi\f[R]), \f[B]256\f[R], or
\f[B]iterm\f[R].
If not provided, the output color depth will be inferred with
\f[C]tput colors\f[R].
.TP
.B \f[B]-h\f[R], \f[B]--help\f[R]
Show common options and quit.
.TP
.B \f[B]-H\f[R], \f[B]--half-height\f[R]
Prints half-height blocks to double the vertical resolution, and make
for a less squished image.
Works best when each character cell is exactly twice as tall as it is
wide and when your terminal is using a bitmapped font.
.TP
.B \f[B]-r\f[R] \f[I]ROWS\f[R], \f[B]--height\f[R]=\f[I]ROWS\f[R]
Resizes the image to \f[I]ROWS\f[R] characters high.
Does nothing if \f[B]--no-resize\f[R] is provided.
Maintains the original image\[aq]s aspect ratio if \f[B]--width\f[R] is
NOT provided.
.TP
.B \f[B]-R\f[R], \f[B]--no-resize\f[R]
Does not resize the image to fit the terminal\[aq]s width.
Overrides both \f[B]--width\f[R] and \f[B]--height\f[R].
.TP
.B \f[B]-v\f[R], \f[B]--version\f[R]
Show version and quit.
.TP
.B \f[B]-w\f[R] \f[I]COLS\f[R], \f[B]--width\f[R]=\f[I]COLS\f[R]
Shrink the image to \f[I]COLS\f[R] characters wide.
Does nothing if \f[B]--no-resize\f[R] is provided, or if the image is
already as small as the provided width.
Maintains the original image\[aq]s aspect ratio if \f[B]--height\f[R] is
NOT provided.
.TP
.B \f[B]--8\f[R], \f[B]--ansi\f[R]
Set the output colour depth to 8.
Same as \f[B]--depth=8\f[R].
.TP
.B \f[B]--256\f[R]
Set the output colour depth to 256.
Same as \f[B]--depth=256\f[R].
.TP
.B \f[B]--iterm2\f[R]
Set the output to iTerm inline image mode.
Same as \f[B]--depth=iterm2\f[R].
.SS iTerm2 3.0
.PP
\f[B]imgcat\f[R] supports iTerm2\[aq]s full-color inline images (use
\f[B]-d iterm\f[R] to explicitly enable this).
However, iTerm2 is bundled with a script that is also called
\f[B]imgcat\f[R]! To use this program in preference to the script
bundled with iTerm2, edit your shell\[aq]s configuration file such that,
after the line that sources iTerm2\[aq]s shell integration and
utilities, you unalias its built-in script:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
unalias imgcat
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Troubleshooting
.PP
First, test how many colors your terminal can output:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ tput colors
256
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If this is not what you expect, you might want to change your
\f[C]TERM\f[R] environment variable.
For example, iTerm2 users will probably want the following:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ export TERM=xterm-256color
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
However, it\[aq]s better that your terminal emulator reports itself with
the proper value for \f[C]TERM\f[R].
For iTerm2, again, look under the current profile settings > Terminal >
Terminal Emulation > and change \[dq]Report Terminal Type\[dq].
