Install
-------

On OS X:

```sh
brew tap eddieantonio/eddieantonio
brew install imgcat
```

**Important**: [See below](#note-on-iterm2s-shell-integration) if
you're using iTerm2 3.0 with shell integration installed.

For other platforms, see [Build](#build).


Usage
-----

```sh
imgcat some_image.jpg
```

See the [manpage](./docs/imgcat.1.md) for more invocations.

Note on iTerm2's shell integration
----------------------------------

If you install iTerm2's [shell integration], chances are you also
installed its additional scripts, including one called `imgcat`.
**iTerm's `imgcat` overrides this program by default**. To see if this
is happening to you, use `which` to determine where your shell is
finding imgcat:

    which imgcat

If it says `imgcat: aliased to /Users/yourusername/.iterm2/imgcat`, then
you must edit your shell startup file and add `unalias imgcat` **after**
the line that sources iTerm2's script. For example:

    test -e ${HOME}/.iterm2_shell_integration.zsh && source ${HOME}/.iterm2_shell_integration.zsh
    unalias imgcat

Build
-----

### Requirements

- libncurses5-dev (if `make` complains about missing `term.h`, then you don't have it)

(You most likely already have both of these).

 - GNU make
 - GNU autotools

Then:

```sh
autoconf
./configure
make
```

Install
-------

To install to `/usr/local`:

```sh
make install
```

To change the default prefix, simply provide `PREFIX=...`
to `make install`:

```sh
make install PREFIX=/opt
```
