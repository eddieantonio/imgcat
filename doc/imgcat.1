\f[B]imgcat\f[] \- cat, but for images
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]imgcat\f[] [\f[B]\-w\f[] \f[I]COLS\f[]|\f[B]\-R\f[]] [\f[B]\-d\f[]
\f[I]MODE\f[]] [\f[I]options\f[]] \f[I]image.ext\f[]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]imgcat\f[] prints images to your terminal screen.
Yes, indeed it does.
.PP
By default, the image is printed at the full width and colour depth
detected for your terminal.
These can be overridden using \f[B]\-w\f[] to adjust the maximum width
or \f[B]\-R\f[] to prevent resizing, even if the image is too big to fit
in the terminal; and \f[B]\-d\f[] to explicitly the set color depth.
.PP
\f[B]Make sure your \f[C]TERM\f[] environment variable is set to a
terminfo with the full capabilities of you terminal!\f[] See
\f[B]Troubleshooting\f[] if you\[aq]re having a problem with this.
.PP
If the output stream is not a terminal (that is, output is redirected to
a file, or piped into another program), then the image is \f[B]not\f[]
resized to the size of the terminal.
It does, however, uses the color depth of terminal set in the
\f[C]TERM\f[] environment variable.
Overriding both width and color depth still work.
.SS Options
.TP
.B \f[B]\-w\f[] \f[I]COLS\f[], \f[B]\-\-width\f[]=\f[I]COLS\f[]
Shrink the image to \f[I]COLS\f[] characters wide (maintaining aspect
ratio).
Does nothing if \f[B]\-\-no\-resize\f[] is provided, or if the image is
already as small as the provided width.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[B]\-d\f[] \f[I]MODE\f[], \f[B]\-\-depth\f[]=\f[I]MODE\f[]
Explicitly set the output color depth to one of \f[B]ansi\f[],
\f[B]8\f[] (alias of \f[B]ansi\f[]), or \f[B]256\f[].
If not provided, the output color depth will be inferred with
\f[C]tput\ colors\f[].
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[B]\-R\f[], \f[B]\-\-no\-resize\f[]
Does not resize the image to fit the terminal\[aq]s width.
Overrides \f[B]\-\-width\f[].

.SS Troubleshooting
.PP
First, test how many colors your terminal can output:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ tput\ colors
256
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If this is not what you expect, you might want to change your
\f[C]TERM\f[] environment variable.
For example, iTerm2 users will probably want the following:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ export\ TERM=xterm\-256color
\f[]
.fi
.PP
However, it\[aq]s better that your terminal emulator reports itself with
the proper value for \f[C]TERM\f[].
For iTerm2, again, look under the current profile settings > Terminal >
Terminal Emulation > and change "Report Terminal Type".
